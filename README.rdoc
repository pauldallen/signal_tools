== UPDATE
This has been updated to work with YQuotes as the yahoo api was changed/discontinued

== Signal Tools

Signal tools allows you to generate technical analysis data for a given stock (like MACD, stochastic, and exponential moving averages).

== Installation

    gem install signal_tools

== Usage

    require 'signal_tools'

    stock = SignalTools::Stock.new('GOOG', '2010-01-01', '2010-05-31')
    # Leave the last parameter blank to get from a previous date up until today:
    stock = SignalTools::Stock.new('GOOG', '2010-01-01')
    # Leave both dates blank to get the past 90 days:
    stock = SignalTools::Stock.new('GOOG')

    # Generate MACD signal with an 8 day short period, 17 day long period, and 9 day EMA signal period:
    stock.macd(8, 17, 9)

    # Generate slow stochastic signal with a 14 day K period and a 5 day D period:
    stock.slow_stochastic(14, 5)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
